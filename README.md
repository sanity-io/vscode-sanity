# vscode-sanity

Extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that makes developing applications for [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) that much more awesome.

## Features

### GROQ syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting for the GROQ query language is available in the following situations:

- Files with the `.groq` extension
- Fenced code blocks in Markdown with the `groq` tag
- Tagged template literals with the `groq` tag
- Queries using the `defineQuery` method
- Template literals prefixed with the `/* groq */` comment
- Template literals starting with a `// groq` comment

### Execute GROQ-queries

When GROQ-queries are detected, the extension will allow you to run the query and displays the result as JSON in a separate tab.

The project ID and dataset used is determined by finding `sanity.cli.ts` in the workspace. If multiple files are found, the extension will prompt you to select one.

If the GROQ file/query has any variables, then extension asks for a relative filename of a JSON-file containing an object of key-value mappings. It autofills the param filename based on the current file with a `.json` extension, if it exists.
